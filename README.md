Meter Bill Multiagent system using Java

# Meter Bill Agent

**Meter Bill Agent** is a legacy software solution designed to streamline the process of managing and generating utility meter bills. Although this project is no longer actively maintained and cannot be run due to obsolete dependencies, it stands as a reference to my earlier work in building scalable, automated billing applications.
